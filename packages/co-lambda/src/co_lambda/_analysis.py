"""Specialization analysis written in the lambda-calculus itself.

The analysis that decides which sub-terms to specialize is a pure lambda term, run by the
interpreter on the quoted program, so the calculus analyzes its own programs: a demonstration that
tabling-based reduction expresses program analysis, not only evaluation. This module holds the
closedness and depth measures; richer certificates (typability, fuel-bounded normalization) live in
``_typecheck`` and ``_reduce`` in the same style.

This module is pure lambda calculus: every top-level binding is a ``Builder`` (a ``@curry``-decorated
``def`` IS a Builder). The Python-side verdict readers live at the boundary (``_specialize``).

``LOOSE_BOUND`` is a DEPTH-FREE closedness measure, so the interpreter's interning shares it across
every position: ``LOOSE_BOUND quoted`` takes no binder depth, so ``app(LOOSE_BOUND, sub)`` is the
SAME node for an interned sub-term and is tabled once; a whole-tree scan is then linear. It returns
the number of enclosing binders the sub-term needs (the de Bruijn ``loose_bound``): a variable needs
index+1, an abstraction discharges one (floored at zero by ``PRED``), an application needs the larger
of the two. A sub-term is closed exactly when it needs none (``IS_CLOSED``).
