"""Weak head normalization: a term's outermost constructor, computed as a least fixpoint by tabling.

``weak_head_normalize`` exposes a node's outermost constructor after weak head reduction (it stops
at the outermost constructor and does not reduce under ``lambda``). A deterministic calculus
exposes exactly one constructor at a node, so the value is a single node
(``Var``/``Lam``/``App``/``Native``) or ``BOTTOM`` (no constructor), never a set.
``compute_weak_head_normal_form`` is the per-node clause body; ``Node.weak_head_normal_form`` wraps
it in a ``fixpoint_cached_property`` resolved as a least fixpoint from ``BOTTOM`` upward. Because
nodes are interned, a node reached again during its own computation is caught by a pointer test; an
unproductive cycle (a re-entry with no constructor exposed, as in ``Omega`` or ``Y (lambda x. x)``)
stabilizes at ``BOTTOM``.

A reduction budget (a context variable) bounds beta-reduction so a genuinely non-rational reduction
surfaces as ``ReductionBudgetExceeded`` instead of hanging.

    This is the fusion of weak head normalization and combinatory (SK) reduction. From weak head
    normalization it keeps call-by-name beta, where the argument is inserted by reference (not
    reduced), so the caller's tabling folds both an unproductive cycle (``Omega`` to bottom) and a
    productive one (``Y (cons 0)`` to a finite cyclic graph); a fully lazy SK reduction cannot fold,
    because its ``S`` rule grows the argument into suspensions that never re-form the cyclic node, and
    reducing them first (call by value) diverges on a productive cycle. From combinatory reduction it
    keeps the motivation to avoid copying the whole tree: it fires at most ``depth`` beta contractions
    per application position and leaves a still-unfired redex ``App(Lam(body), argument)`` (the
    let-stub ``(\\a. body) argument``) as a guarded value, rather than substituting an unbounded tree.

    A ``depth`` large enough reproduces the Levy-Longo weak head normal form, ``depth == 1`` is the
    one-layer reading, and ``depth == 0`` reads the term raw. It never consults the cached
    ``weak_head_normal_form`` (the unbounded least fixpoint), so the cached semantics is untouched;
    each contraction goes through ``substitute`` (which returns closed subterms by reference and builds
    with the interning ``make_*``), so closed cyclic data is shared and structurally identical results
    fold at every reduced layer, the per-layer tabling guarantee that lets a cycle closing within the
    depth fold and halt. ``depth`` bounds firings, so every head reduction terminates regardless of
    rationality; the readout's tree is folded by the caller (``render`` tables re-entrant closed
    nodes), so a rational behaviour whose cycle closes within the depth reads as a finite cyclic graph.
