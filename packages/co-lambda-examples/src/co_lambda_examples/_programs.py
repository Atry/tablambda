"""Demo encoders and built example nodes (boundary test data, not compiler source).

Holds the example material split out of the pure-lambda ``_prelude``: built (interned) example
``Node``s, node-level assembly helpers whose point is interning-aware sharing, and the demo
ENCODERS that mechanically encode a Python problem description (a ground Datalog program, a tree
shape) into a lambda term. The encoders are codecs in the register's sense (their non-Builder
parameters are the data being encoded); they live here rather than in ``_codec`` because they are
demonstration harnesses, not part of the compiler's input/output path.
