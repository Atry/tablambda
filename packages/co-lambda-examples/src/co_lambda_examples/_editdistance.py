"""Edit distance: a hard dynamic program that is trivial in this framework.

The Levenshtein distance between two strings is the textbook example of a problem whose naive
recursion is exponential and whose efficient solution needs a memoization table. Here the recursion is
written directly as a pure lambda term and the table is *free*: the interpreter identifies a state
with its behaviour by node identity (interning), and the subproblems of edit distance are pairs of
*suffixes* of the two inputs, which are shared sub-nodes of the input lists. So ``ed tailA tailB`` for
a given suffix pair is literally the same ``App`` node every time it arises, and the interpreter
computes its weak head normal form once and caches it. The exponential call tree collapses to the
``(m+1)(n+1)`` distinct suffix pairs, the classic O(mn) table, with no memoization code written.

Costs are BinNats (``_binnat``), so the arithmetic (successor, three-way minimum) is logarithmic in
the distance rather than unary. A string is a Scott list of BinNat character codes; characters are
compared with ``BIN_EQUAL``.
