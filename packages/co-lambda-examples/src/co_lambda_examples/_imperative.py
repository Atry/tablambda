"""Imperative specialization of a productive rational stream: loops from folding.

``GEN`` is a pure lambda term that maps a Scott stream ``cons h t`` to a quoted output stream
``Yield h (GEN t)`` (and ``nil`` to ``Stop``). It is an ordinary productive recursion with nothing
loop-aware in it. Run on a *cyclic* source (e.g. ``Y (cons 0)``), the recursive ``GEN t`` re-enters
the same interned state, so the interpreter (``fixpoint_cached_property`` + interning) folds the back
edge and the output is a *cyclic* quoted stream. The cycle-aware decoder (``_programs``) walks that
output with a visited set and emits a Python generator whose ``while`` loop is exactly the folded back
edge. On a finite source the same ``GEN`` yields a finite, loopless generator.

This is not meta-tracing. Meta-tracing compiles traces *of an interpreter*, which requires the
interpreter to be written in the traced language (a self-interpreter); here the lambda term ``GEN``
is the program, and the interpreter folds *its* behaviour, so this is ahead-of-time specialization
of a program, not a trace of an interpreter.

This module is pure lambda calculus: every top-level binding is a ``Builder``. The output-stream
decoder and the demo driver live in ``_programs``.
